### Installation
1. Clone thee repo: `git clone https://github.com/Lindsay-B-Miller/Clicky-Game

## Usage
Upon loading the page, users view 12 landscape cards from which they can choose. Once a card has been clicked, the deck shuffles and thee user can click on another card. If the user clicks on the same card more than once, the game is over and the app reloads. The goal is for thee user to select all 12 cards without clicking on the same one twice. A counter keeps track of the user's score and updates the high score accordingly.
